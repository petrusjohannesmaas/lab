    "\n",
    "This manual is going to illustrate how I have created a secure CLI password manager that is cloud based using Python and a MariaDB database hosted on a DigitalOcean droplet. The password manager will allow you to store, retrieve, and update passwords in a secure and encrypted manner. It will also allow you to generate strong passwords for you to use.\n",

    "The project is divided into three main parts:\n",
    "\n",

    "1. The CLI password manager\n",

    "### 1. The CLI password manager\n",
    "\n",
    "The CLI password manager is a Python script that allows you to store, retrieve, and update passwords in a secure and encrypted manner. It uses the Fernet encryption method to encrypt and decrypt passwords before storing them in the database. The Fernet encryption method is a symmetric encryption method that uses a shared secret key to encrypt and decrypt data."

    "### 3) The database connection\n",
    "\n",
    "I used 127.0.0.1 as the host in my database connection because it refers to the local loopback interface, which allows the application to connect to services running on the same machine. In this case, the database is hosted on the SSH server, and by establishing an SSH tunnel, your code effectively forwards requests from your local machine to the database serverâ€™s local address. This setup ensures a secure connection while allowing you to access the database as if it were running locally on your own machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through the logic I implemented to connect to the database and execute queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SSH Tunnel**: \n",
    "   - First, we create an SSH tunnel to securely connect to the remote database server using the `SSHTunnelForwarder`.\n",
    "   - This is done in the `open_ssh_tunnel` function, which starts the tunnel.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **MySQL Connection**:\n",
    "   - After the SSH tunnel is established, we connect to the MariaDB database with `pymysql.connect()` in the `mysql_connect` function.\n",
    "   - We use `localhost` and the local bind port provided by the SSH tunnel.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Query Execution**:\n",
    "   - The `run_query` function executes SQL queries using `pandas` to easily handle the results.\n",
    "   - We perform operations like storing, retrieving, and updating passwords using SQL commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cleanup**:\n",
    "   - Finally, we close the database connection with `mysql_disconnect()` and the SSH tunnel with `close_ssh_tunnel()` when we're done."
