    "### What is a relational database?\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases organize data into rows and columns, forming tables where data points relate to each other. These databases often consist of multiple tables connected via primary or foreign keys, illustrating the relationships through various data models. SQL queries are used to combine these data points, providing insights, optimizing workflows, and identifying opportunities for businesses. For instance, a company might have a table with customer information and another with transaction details. Together, these tables can reveal the industries purchasing specific software products, the number of transactions, and the total revenue generated etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases are essential for managing structured data, ensuring reliable transactions through ACID compliance, and enabling complex data manipulation with SQL. Client/server SQL databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL focus on scalability and centralization, while SQLite offers a lightweight, embedded solution without requiring a separate server process. This makes SQLite ideal for quick deployments and local storage needs."

    "### Communicating with a Relational Database\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is a standard language for interacting with databases. It is used to create, read, update, and delete data in a database. SQL queries are written in the form of a string and are executed by the database engine. As a simple example of this, let's have a look at how we can insert, retrieve, update, and delete data from a database using SQL.\n",

    "**The quickest way to get started with Relational databases is by doing the following:**\n",
