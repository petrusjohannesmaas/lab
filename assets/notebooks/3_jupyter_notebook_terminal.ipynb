    "A programming environment is a software tool that helps you make programs. It has three parts: an editor, an interpreter, and a console. The editor is where you write your code. The interpreter is what runs your code. The console is where you see what your code does. A good programming environment can also help you with coding features like colors, suggestions, and error checking."
