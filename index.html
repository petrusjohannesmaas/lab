### Introduction

This is how I'm going to structure my journey to becoming a competent programmer. I've adapted a [Youtube
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QP43F4gVIE) *(very loosely)* with the [Python
Institute's](https://pythoninstitute.org) programming certifications to help create a logical progression of learning
and certification. But before we can get into the details we need to understand what we're trying to achieve.

I aim to incorporate gamification principles and systematic learning in all my research projects to make the learning
process more fun and engaging, while also creating a paper trail of my experiences and knowledge. Additionally,
generating and visualizing data will provides valuable insights on the true nature of my work, which will become
increasingly evident as I progress.

**There are a few basic rules and mechanics for each part of the *Professional Programming* roadmap.** 

1. **Lore**: A generalized description of what you need to learn or accomplish.
2. **Main-boss**: Specific course material or a certification that needs to be completed.
3. **Quest**: A big research project that demonstrates the skills, tools and knowledge you have collected along the way.    
4. **Skills**: Things you gain an understanding of through research and documentation.
5. **Manuals**: Cheatsheets and guides that can be referenced again and again.
6. **Programs**: Modules and scripts that demonstrate practical skills.
